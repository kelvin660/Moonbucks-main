The cost of living crisis is a global phenomenon no doubt but Britons may end up having it worse than anyone else Kristin Forbes a former member of the Bank of England s Monetary Policy Committee warned last week that there s about six factors that feed through into inflation and the UK hits every box People in most countries are feeling the pain from higher energy bills supply chain disruptions and a hangover from the pandemic However price pressures in the UK are expected to be worse and longer lasting Why It s largely thanks to an extremely tight jobs market a plunging pound and higher inflation expectations Britain is set to experience a toxic combination of these price drivers In addition the UK is putting up taxes on households something few governments are daring to do at a time of soaring living costs Forbes now an economics professor at MIT told the Treasury Committee last week Put it all together you see why this is a particularly difficult challenge for the UK and why inflation could hit even 10pc by the fall of this year It is unlikely to hit those sorts of numbers in other countries The inflation rate has already jumped to 7pc but forecasters expect the pressures to get much worse and remain high in the UK for longer Figures this week are forecast to reveal that inflation exceeded 9pc in April and the Bank of England s latest set of gloomy projections predicted the rate will hit double digits by the end of the year levels last seen four decades ago The IMF s latest forecasts show inflation in the UK hitting 7 4pc over 2022 as a whole That is much higher than the projections of around 4 6pc for the big four eurozone economies of Germany France Italy and Spain but slightly lower than the US and in line with many other advanced economies However high inflation is expected to stick around for longer in Britain While the consumer prices index CPI is expected to fall back to between 2 3pc in every major advanced economy next year the IMF believes it will stay well above target in the UK at more than 5pc in 2023 Paul Dales chief UK economist at Capital Economics says I agree with a lot of Forbes comments although most major economies are experiencing a lot of the same inflationary factors The US doesn t have a weaker exchange rate but the eurozone does The factor that is really only UK specific is Brexit It may not necessarily mean that the inflationary pressures in the UK are much much bigger than elsewhere But I think it does mean that more of the inflationary pressures are at risk of lasting longer than elsewhere Shortage of workers A shrinking labour force is fuelling inflation with businesses forced to pay staff more money to attract the talent they need The pool of workers available to firms has not bounced back to pre Covid levels and tighter immigration controls have cut the supply of cheap labour from Europe Adam Posen a former Bank of England rate setter believes this helps to explain more than half of the difference between UK and eurozone inflation Ministers remain reluctant to use immigration to solve worker shortages A dearth of labour is also partly down to the great resignation observed during the pandemic including many elderly workers who have decided to retire early during the upheaval According to the Institute for Employment Studies there are now 1 2m fewer people in Britain s labour force than before the Covid crisis While the US is also experiencing a scramble for workers the UK labour market is much tighter than Europe s There are fears those pay pressures could lead to a wage price spiral where higher incomes feed back into inflation The ONS said average pay excluding bonuses rose by 3 7pc from October to December 2021 in the UK Over the comparable period EU data shows hourly wages in the bloc rose by just 2 3pc Sinking sterling The UK also ticks the boxes for a weaker currency and higher inflation expectations a key determinant of future price growth The pound has fallen by almost 10pc against the dollar this year hitting a two year low last week as speculators ramp up bets on a further drop Sterling has been knocked by recession fears in the UK and expectations that the Bank of England s interest rate rises to tame inflation will be less aggressive than the US Federal Reserve s A struggling pound pushes up the cost of imports but the eurozone has also experienced a similar fall in its currency versus the dollar Inflation expectations are one area in which the eurozone has weaker price pressures than the UK Since the financial crisis the UK has consistently had a higher inflation rate and thus higher expectations for future price rises The British public s inflation expectations for the coming 12 months hit a record high of 6 1pc in March though it eased back to 6pc in April according to a survey by Citi and YouGov Forbes said The UK is coming into this period with inflation that has been higher and more volatile so people are faster to adjust prices and adjust inflation expectations Higher inflation expectations causes workers to demand bigger wage increases to offset the income shock while a history of higher prices means businesses are more comfortable passing on costs to shoppers according to Forbes Goldman Sachs economist Sven Jari Stehn says the increase in inflation expectations also looks more pronounced in the UK compared to the US Forward rates of expectations which discount near term price expectations that are related to energy prices remain more clearly anchored around 2pc in the US The risk of intervention With political pressure building on the Government it could be pushed into more support for households facing a huge fall in living standards So far the UK also appears unique in the Government s decision to put up taxes at a time when families are feeling the squeeze The Chancellor has hit households with the National Insurance hike and by freezing tax thresholds to drag more people into higher bands The Labour party has warned the UK is the only G7 country putting up taxes this year But economists fear large scale aid could add to price pressures Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees Mogg admitted last week that a constrained fiscal policy combined with tighter monetary policy is needed to tackle inflation But the Prime Minister and Chancellor are feeling the heat following difficult local elections that saw the loss of hundreds of Tory councillors and flagship councils in London If the election results convince the PM and Chancellor to bring forward fiscal support and if the Northern Ireland protocol is ditched Dales says it would at the margin add to price pressures in the UK The IMF has warned countries to target their support at the poorest households Helping families with the cost of living too much risks stoking price pressures instead of letting fall back and ease the pressure The inflation shock is a global phenomenon but UK households may need to prepare for price pain that is longer and worse than almost anywhere else
